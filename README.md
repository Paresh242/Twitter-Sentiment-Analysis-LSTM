# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis-LSTM
Overview This script performs EDA and then preprocesses multiple datasets to train a bidirectional LSTM model which is in turn used to predict the sentiments behind tweets fetched in real time using tweepy and classify them as positive negative or neutral.  The model is then integrated with streamlet and deployed as a web-app.
